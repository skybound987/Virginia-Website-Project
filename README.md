# Virginia-Website-Project
A website project for a college course on front-end web development.

It features the state of Virginia and consists of a main web page, a capital city web page, and two additional cities within Virginia.

The website folder contains all the HTML, CSS, and images associated with building the website.

The site is hosted on W3 schools but it is only formatted for desktop viewing, I am planning to make the site mobile friendly.
